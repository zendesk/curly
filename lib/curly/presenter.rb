module Curly

  # A base class that can be subclassed by concrete presenters.
  #
  # A Curly presenter is responsible for delivering data to templates, in the
  # form of simple strings. Each public instance method on the presenter class
  # can be referenced in a template. When a template is evaluated with a
  # presenter, the referenced methods will be called with no arguments, and
  # the returned strings inserted in place of the components in the template.
  #
  # Note that strings that are not HTML safe will be escaped.
  #
  # A presenter is always instantiated with a context to which it delegates
  # unknown messages, usually an instance of ActionView::Base provided by
  # Rails. See Curly::TemplateHandler for a typical use.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   class BlogPresenter < Curly::Presenter
  #     presents :post
  #
  #     def title
  #       @post.title
  #     end
  #
  #     def body
  #       markdown(@post.body)
  #     end
  #
  #     def author
  #       @post.author.full_name
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   presenter = BlogPresenter.new(context, post: post)
  #   presenter.author #=> "Jackie Chan"
  #
  class Presenter

    # Initializes the presenter with the given context and options.
    #
    # context - An ActionView::Base context.
    # options - A Hash of options given to the presenter.
    def initialize(context, options = {})
      @_context = context
      options.stringify_keys!

      self.class.presented_names.each do |name|
        value = options.fetch(name) do
          default_values.fetch(name) do
            block = default_blocks.fetch(name) do
              raise ArgumentError.new("required identifier `#{name}` missing")
            end

            instance_exec(name, &block)
          end
        end

        instance_variable_set("@#{name}", value)
      end
    end

    # Sets up the view.
    #
    # Override this method in your presenter in order to do setup before the
    # template is rendered. One use case is to call `content_for` in order
    # to inject content into other templates, e.g. a layout.
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   class Posts::ShowPresenter < Curly::Presenter
    #     presents :post
    #
    #     def setup!
    #       content_for :page_title, @post.title
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Returns nothing.
    def setup!
      # Does nothing.
    end

    # The key that should be used to cache the view.
    #
    # Unless `#cache_key` returns nil, the result of rendering the template
    # that the presenter supports will be cached. The return value will be
    # part of the final cache key, along with a digest of the template itself.
    #
    # Any object can be used as a cache key, so long as it
    #
    # - is a String,
    # - responds to #cache_key itself, or
    # - is an Array or a Hash whose items themselves fit either of these
    #   criteria.
    #
    # Returns the cache key Object or nil if no caching should be performed.
    def cache_key
      nil
    end

    # The options that should be passed to the cache backend when caching the
    # view. The exact options may vary depending on the backend you're using.
    #
    # The most common option is `:expires_in`, which controls the duration of
    # time that the cached view should be considered fresh. Because it's so
    # common, you can set that option simply by defining `#cache_duration`.
    #
    # Note: if you set the `:expires_in` option through this method, the
    # `#cache_duration` value will be ignored.
    #
    # Returns a Hash.
    def cache_options
      {}
    end

    # The duration that the view should be cached for. Only relevant if
    # `#cache_key` returns a non nil value.
    #
    # If nil, the view will not have an expiration time set. See also
    # `#cache_options` for a more flexible way to set cache options.
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   def cache_duration
    #     10.minutes
    #   end
    #
    # Returns the Fixnum duration of the cache item, in seconds, or nil if no
    #   duration should be set.
